This is a trip planning app on Android Studio, should you want to use it, download the WanderSync Folder and open it through Android Studio. Then use Java as the language and Groovy instead of Kolin. Make sure FireBase is also set up when you open the folder to allow real time data

Or if you wish to download this app / apk, go to my portfolio project section: https://rayc6564.github.io/Project/disclaimer.html
